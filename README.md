Problem Statement
Given the following JSON data
[{"Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 171, "WeightKg": 96 },
{ "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 161, "WeightKg": 85 },
{ "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 180, "WeightKg": 77 },
{ "Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 166, "WeightKg": 62},
{"Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 150, "WeightKg": 70},
{"Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 167, "WeightKg": 82}]
as the input with weight and height parameters of a person, we have to perform
the following:
1) Calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) using Formula 1, BMI Category and
Health risk from Table 1 of the person and add them as 3 new columns
2) Count the total number of overweight people using ranges in the column BMI
Category of Table 1, check this is consistent programmatically and add any
other observations in the documentation
3) Create build, tests to make sure the code is working as expected and this
can be added to an automation build / testing / deployment pipeline
Formula 1 - BMI
BMI(kg/m2) = mass(kg) / height(m)2
The BMI (Body Mass Index) in (kg/m2
) is equal to the weight in kilograms (kg)
divided by your height in meters squared (m)2
. For example, if you are 175cm
(1.75m) in height and 75kg in weight, you can calculate your BMI as follows: 75kg
/ (1.75m²) = 24.49kg/m²
Table 1 - BMI Category and the Health Risk.
BMI Category BMI Range (kg/m2) Health risk
Underweight 18.4 and below Malnutrition risk
Normal weight 18.5 - 24.9 Low risk
Overweight 25 - 29.9 Enhanced risk
Moderately obese 30 - 34.9 Medium risk
Severely obese 35 - 39.9 High risk
Very severely obese 40 and above Very high risk
Challenge
1) Write a solid production-grade Python3 Program to solve this problem,
imagine this will be used in-product for 1 Lac patients. We are only
interested in a standalone backend application, we are NOT expecting a UI,
webpage, frontend, Mobile App, microsite etc. We want to see what optimal
solution you come up with to scale for larger JSON data and perform
calculations quickly and write the output efficiently. Feel free to explore and
use the standard Python libraries or any open source Python modules
2) Automate the setup, build, testing, package and run using your favourite
tools
